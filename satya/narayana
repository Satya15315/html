You cannot post images to Instagram via API unless youâ€™re using a Business account via Instagram Graph API.

Instagram automation (like scraping or logging in) violates their terms of service and may get your account banned.

If you need to automate posting, you must go through Facebook Graph API, which requires app review and approval.
